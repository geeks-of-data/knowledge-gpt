# Pip Lib

`https://pypi.org/project/knowledgegpt/`

- To use library
- `pip install knowledgegpt`

## Before run project locally

- Please check config file use own open-ai api-key and your own mongo uri

# knowledgegpt

***knowledgegpt*** is designed to gather information from various sources, including the internet and local data, which
can be used to create prompts. These prompts can then be utilized by OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate answers that are
subsequently stored in a database for future reference.

To accomplish this, the text is first transformed into a fixed-size vector using either open source or OpenAI models.
When a query is submitted, the text is also transformed into a vector and compared to the stored knowledge embeddings.
The most relevant information is then selected and used to generate a prompt context.

***knowledgegpt*** supports various information sources including websites, PDFs, PowerPoint files (PPTX), and
documents (Docs). Additionally, it can extract text from YouTube subtitles and audio (using speech-to-text technology)
and use it as a source of information. This allows for a diverse range of information to be gathered and used for
generating prompts and answers.

## How to use

#### Restful API

```uvicorn server:app --reload```

#### How to install the library

```pip install knowledgegpt```
or

```
git clone https://github.com/geeks-of-data/knowledge-gpt.git
pip install .
```

Before running for the first time download the related spacy model by running:

```
# !python3 -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
# !python3 -m pip install -U spacy
# !python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

#### How to use the library

```python
# Import the library
from knowledgegpt.extractors.web_scrape_extractor import WebScrapeExtractor

# Import OpenAI and Set the API Key
import openai
from example_config import SECRET_KEY 
openai.api_key = SECRET_KEY

# Define target website
url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombard_(weapon)"

# Initialize the WebScrapeExtractor
scrape_website = WebScrapeExtractor( url=url, embedding_extractor="hf", model_lang="en")

# Prompt the OpenAI Model
answer, prompt, messages = scrape_website.extract(query="What is a bombard?",max_tokens=300,  to_save=True, mongo_client=db)

# See the answer
print(answer)

# Output: 'A bombard is a type of large cannon used during the 14th to 15th centuries.'

```

Other examples can be found in the [examples](./examples) folder.
But to give a better idea of how to use the library, here is a simple example:

```python
# Basic Usage
basic_extractor = BaseExtractor(df)
answer, prompt, messages = basic_extractor.extract("What is the title of this PDF?", max_tokens=300)
```

```python
# PDF Extraction
pdf_extractor = PDFExtractor( pdf_file_path, extraction_type="page", embedding_extractor="hf", model_lang="en", )
answer, prompt, messages = pdf_extractor.extract(query, max_tokens=1500)
```

```python
# PPTX Extraction
ppt_extractor = PowerpointExtractor(file_path=ppt_file_path, embedding_extractor="hf", model_lang="en")
answer, prompt, messages = ppt_extractor.extract( query,max_tokens=500)
```

```python
# DOCX Extraction
docs_extractor = DocsExtractor(file_path="../example.docx", embedding_extractor="hf", model_lang="en", is_turbo=False)
answer, prompt, messages = \
    docs_extractor.extract( query="What is an object detection system?", max_tokens=300)
```

```python
# Extraction from Youtube video (audio)
scrape_yt_audio = YoutubeAudioExtractor(video_id=url, model_lang='tr', embedding_extractor='hf')
answer, prompt, messages = scrape_yt_audio.extract( query=query, max_tokens=1200)

# Extraction from Youtube video (transcript)
scrape_yt_subs = YTSubsExtractor(video_id=url, embedding_extractor='hf', model_lang='en')
answer, prompt, messages = scrape_yt_subs.extract( query=query, max_tokens=1200)
```
